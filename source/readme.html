<p>CodeReddit Reborn is a gag site where you can browse reddit while
appearing to be working on code. It was made by <a href="http://kpetrovi.ch">Kyle Petrovich</a> as a way to practice using jQuery.</p>
<p>It was inspired in part by <a href="http://msworddit.com">MSWorddit.com</a> and <a href="http://www.codereddit.com">the original codereddit</a> (may it rest in peace).</p>
<p>CodeReddit's dynamic workings are made entirely in javascript, taking advantage of
<a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://www.steamdev.com/snippet/">Snippet</a>, and <a href="http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/">jQuery BBQ</a>. </p>
<p>It is available on <a href="https://github.com/fozzle/codereddit">GitHub</a>, and I'd love to see it improved upon. Though in all honesty, this
whole thing is super hacky. Started it on a whim one afternoon and didn't really put any thought into architecture.</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can switch subreddits by clicking on a subreddit from the front page
or adding a #subreddit hash tag</li>
<li>Soon you will be able to switch languages. Almost any major language 
will be supported.</li>
<li>Comments can be found by expanding the "for" loop in the "function"</li>
</ul>
